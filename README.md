# Pipex_42_bonus
The 42 Pipex project introduces Unix systems programming by replicating the shell's pipe (|) functionality. It connects the output of one command to the input of another, mimicking cmd1 | cmd2. This project enhances understanding of processes, file descriptors, and inter-process communication, key concepts in system-level programming.
